# JavaClasswork
Intermediate software development in Java (CS 2110 @ UVA, Fall 2019).
Many of these assignments had provided starter code which should be notated in the actual file. All code which fulfills the instructions of the assignment is my own unless otherwise sourced. 

## HW 1
Assignment instructions from UVA CS dept.:

"Even Instagram started somewhere. In this assignment you will be breaking ground
on a photography application, beginning with the foundational classes PhotoLibrary and Photograph.
These classes will define what it means to be a photograph and PhotoLibrary and how they interact;
specifically a PhotoLibrary may contain photographs a user posts to their photo feed."

Additional specificitions on class functionality were given

## HW 2
Assignment instructions from UVA CS dept.:

"Now that you’ve harnessed the power of Instagram, posting Photographs to your
photos, it’s time for more power! Our photo feeds have gotten out of control and we’d like to be able
to organize our photos a little better, so we’ve introduced Albums! To implement this additional
functionality, you will need to modify your original PhotoLibrary and Photograph classes and add
an Album class."

Additional specificitions on class functionality were given

## HW 3
Assignment instructions from UVA CS dept.:

"The project manager noticed the PhotoLibrary and Album classes have nearly identical functions with regard to a list of photographs and wants you to harness the power of inheritance
to clean then up.
Additionally, the project manager is aware that as a photo library grows, it will be helpful to be
able to better manage large numbers of photos through sorting, searching, and other techniques. To
that end, you have been requested to provide ways to compare Photographs."

Additional specificitions on class functionality were given

## HW 4
Assignment instructions from UVA CS dept.:

"This assignment mimics a possible internship assignment. As a software engineer,
part of your job is to deduce requirements from general instructions and design an elegant solution.
You will typically not be given starter code. Your client or manager may say “I want an iOS app
that does X, Y, and Z” and you will be expected to ask the appropriate design questions so you can
deliver what the customer had in mind effectively and efficiently.
Some of this assignment is intentionally ambiguous. In this case, instead of a client to pose questions
to, some creative license is required, meaning that you will need to make some assumptions about
how this software will best work. Throughout this assignment, comment your code with
any assumptions you make. There are intentionally features in this assignment beyond the inclass material – it is expected you will use the Java documentation to look up APIs to allow you to
execute these requirements. Cite sources in the code comments.
The project owner wants a Graphical User Interface (GUI) front-end to the PhotoLibrary application that we’ve been building. To start development of this application, you have been assigned to
develop a prototype of the album viewer GUI using Swing. "
